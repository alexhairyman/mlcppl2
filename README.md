# Current Version is : v0.0.8a

Go ahead and skip looking at arcy.hh, just make the documentation with cmake and make doxy
=====
The doxygen documentation will be the best way to learn how to use the arcy module once it is completed.
Once I start to add more I will begin to document more and more of the library

I'm in debate as to which of the build systems I want to use, I like ninja the most.
but it is the least suported


## TODOS

* modulize the build system
* add more than just arcy
* FINISH ARCY
* integrate the other parts of the library better
* add more tests
* more thorough testing
* document the other classes better
